# Description of the project

This is a Tableau story that explores the most appealing profile of the listings posted on AirBnB in Austin (Texas, US).

To make this possible, I first conducted a sentiment analysis using Python and the [Natural Language Toolkit](https://www.nltk.org/) (NLTK), so that I could categorize each as positive, neutral or negative.
